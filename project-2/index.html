In a projected future, year 2040, there will be tight administrative borders combined
with an extensive amount nomadic shifts (people who constantly live on the move), generating
an independent system called “nomadic settlements”.  This system will initially be utilized by
the people who were refused the right to move. Hence, denied the opportunity to develop.  
Namely Loop, this independent system will be available to future nomads, all those general people
who will be attracted by the idea of life on the move. 

It facilitates borderless movement, due to the fact that these people will never reach their
“final destination”, therefore they won’t be stopped by any administrative borders. Its structure
is inspired by an electronic circuit, in which components work as stations and flow as impulses.  
Several stations arranged around the world will provide the modern nomads with specific
amenities (e.g. cities that are already following this trend: London Banking, L.A. Technology,
New York Law and Gent Education).  

In the microsystem of Gent, the station of Gent Sint Pieters will be a catalyst around facilities.
In this scenario, nomads will be provided the basic needs to stay in the city for a short period of time,
in order to develop themselves by using the infrastructure that the city already provides,
such as universities, research centers, etc. 

Basic needs will be supplied by spaces that are already abandoned by the actual society.
These vacancies would then be used for the temporary character of the future nomads, redefining their identity. 
Surrounded by and related with vacancies, the St Pieters station is considered to be the only space in
the city that will maintain constant activity. The station is projected to stand as a symbol of
timelessness and never become vacant.

Sınce the station will be the first contact of the newcomıng nomads with the city, it shall provide
them with an essential feature: language. Nomads interact with landmarks on the way to/from the train station.
